# PyScipts

\version 1.0

This is a compilation of Python tools that I have written for personal data analysis, plotting, and calculations relevant to nuclear engineering applications.

## Running 

Other than importing the desired modules and functions, no special build is required to run these tools.

## Building Documentation

To build the documentation, in the <a href='../src'>docs/src directory</a> run the command:

\>> doxygen Doxyfile

This will build the html and latex version of the documentation.  The <a href='../index.html'>symlink</a> in the <a href='../'>docs directory</a> for the html index should automatically update.  If not the html index can be found <a href='../html/index.html'>here</a>.

If an update of the latex documentation is desired, go to the <a href='../latex'>docs/latex directory </a> and run the command:

\>> make

This will build the latex documentation.  The updated documentation file will be named <a href='../latex/refman.pdf'>refman.pdf </a> and be placed in this directory.
